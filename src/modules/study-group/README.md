1. Prefill "events" with premise
2. GM generates an observation for the relevant actors, based on their senses

(loop)


Environment: description -> flavor describing the world
Environment: events -> factual representation of events that have happened 
Agent: Memory -> log of observations received, proposed actions, and results

Agent Prompt structure:
  -> [static] Name, persona, environment
  -> [semi-dynamic] memories (aka, past observations and logged actions)
  -> [dynamic] current_observations -> generated by GameMaster, filtered and interpetted to match the agents perception
